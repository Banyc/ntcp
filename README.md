# NTCP

TCP but with a bunch of sockets and a smart scheduler.

## Overview

- NTCP represents only one stream
- NTCP guarantees that the data is delivered in order, without duplication or loss
- NTCP expects unexpected disconnections of some socket connections

## Scheduler

- say:
  - RTT of a TCP connection inversely represents the quality of the connection
  - there are $n$ connections
  - $r \in \mathbb{R}^n$: the RTT vector
    - $r_i$: the RTT of the $i$-th connection
  - $w \in \mathbb{R}^n$: the weight vector
    - $\frac{w}{\| w \|_1} = 1$
    - $w_i$: the weight of the $i$-th connection
  - $N(v)$: standardize a vector $v$
  - $l : \mathbb{R}^n \times \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$: the loss function
  - $w' \in \mathbb{R}^n$: the next weight vector
  - $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$: the learning rate
    - $a \in (10^{-6}, 1)$
- goal: minimize $l$
- the default weight vector $w$:
  ```math
  w = \left( \frac{1}{n}, \dots, \frac{1}{n} \right)
  ```
- the loss function $l$:
  ```math
  l(r, w) = \frac{r}{\| r \|_1} \cdot | w - y |
  ```
  - $y$: an one-hot vector
    - ```math
      y_i =
      \begin{cases}
        1 & i = \arg \min_i r_i \\
        0 & \text{otherwise} \\
      \end{cases}
      ```
- the next weight vector $w' \in \mathbb{R}^n$:
  ```math
  v = w - \alpha \nabla l(r, w) \\
  v_i' =
  \begin{cases}
    0 & v_i < 0 \\
    v_i & v_i \geq 0 \\
  \end{cases} \\
  w' = \frac{v'}{\| v' \|_1} \\
  ```
  - $r$: considered as a constant vector in $\nabla l$

## Send

- entity relationship diagram:
  ```dot
  digraph {
    "Payload seq" -> FD
    "Payload seq" -> "RTT stopwatch"
    "Payload seq" -> Payload
    "Payload seq" -> "Payload queue"
    Payload -> "Payload seq"
    "RTT stopwatch" -> Timeout
    "RTT stopwatch" -> FD
    "RTT stopwatch" -> "Payload seq"
    Timeout -> "RTT stopwatch"
    FD -> RTT
    FD -> Weight
    FD -> "Ping queue"
    FD -> Credit
    RTT -> FD
    Weight -> FD
    Credit -> FD
    "Ping seq" -> FD
    "Ping seq" -> "Ping queue"
    "Ping queue" -> FD
  }
  ```

### FD removal

- problem: the sent but not acknowledged payload from the removed FD will be lost
- on FD removal: steps:
  1. collect all sent but not acknowledged payload sequences to the removed FD
  1. evenly distribute the collected payload sequences to the remaining FDs
  1. tell application to resend the payload

### RTO payload reassignment

- problem: abrupt quality degradation of one connection causes head-of-line blocking of the whole stream
- on RTO: steps:
  1. collect all sent but not acknowledged payload sequences to the FD with RTO
  1. mark all related FDs as bad creditors
  1. evenly distribute the collected payload sequences to the remaining FDs that are good creditors
- on RTT update: steps:
  1. mark all FDs that have their RTTs updated as good creditors
